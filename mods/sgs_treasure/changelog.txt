CHANGELOG
============
Version 2.4
-----------------
-Added checks when playing with BuildCraft, Ender IO, and ExtraUtilities, to behave the same as with Tinker's Construct (that is, you can't place a Treasure
	Chest beside a Block from these mods that gains access to the chest and vice versa).
-Added config properties to enable\disable these checks.
-Fixed Wither Spawner Log from dropping a Wither Spawner Log item, but will drop a regular Wither Log.
-Added a config property for Wither Branches and Wither Roots to control the % chance that they will drop themselves as an item.  Changed the default
	from 25% to 35%.

Version 2.3
-----------------
-Added custom TreasureBiomeDictionary class.
-Added custom DEEP_OCEAN BiomeDictionary.Type.
-Updated all chest, ship, well, wither tree, and building generation to use BiomeDictionary and TreasureBiomeDictionary instead of interrogating the biome name.
-Added configurable (config file) white/black lists for biome Types for chests, ships, wells, wither tree, and buildings.
-Re-organized config file in more logical categories, hopefully making it more user-friendly and easier to understand configuration settings.
-Added many comments to config categories and properties.
-Fixed PaintingPlacholderTileEntity is missing a mapping error.
-Added a medieval townhouse Plan to the forest buildings.

Version 2.2
-----------------
-Fixed Wither Spawner Log name to display correctly.
-When playing with Tinker's Construct mod, if a Tinker's Crafting Station (or vanilla chest) is placed beside a Treasure chest, 
	the Treasure chest will "pop/break" to item form with all items intact.  By default, that means it will be locked again.  The opposite is also true - 
	if a Treasure chest is placed beside a Crafting Station, the chest will "pop/break".
-Added a config property (true/false) to test for Tinker's Construct, so Treasure mod will work even if you don't have Tinker's Construct mod.
-Added a series of white/black list config properties for which Biome Types a Treasure Ship can generate in.

Version 2.1.1
-----------------
-Actually Fixed SkeletonPlaceholder is missing a mapping error this time.

-Fixed Skeleton Warrior not having its name set.
-Added 2 new ships from the Plans contest. 1 large for Deep Ocean and 1 medium for Ocean.

Version 2.0
---------------

-Added Wither Branches, Wither Roots, Wither Key, and Wither Chest
-Added new collectible Art - 1 collection of Small 1x1 Paintings, 2 collections of 2x1 Paintings

-Pirate and Dread Pirate chests - added % chance to drop mob heads.
-Fixed: when breaking chests, they do not unlock.  That kinda defeated the purpose of keys.  So even if they blow up, they shouldn't lose their items, but you'll probably die.

-Fixed issue with too many wishing wells generating after the first one is generated.
